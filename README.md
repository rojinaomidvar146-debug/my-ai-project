Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
This project aims to develop an AI tool that helps users enhance productivity and make better daily decisions. Building AI course project: Personal AI assistant designed to support everyday tasks and learning. Final project for the Building AI course: Intelligent system leveraging AI to simplify daily activities.

## Background
Many people struggle with organizing tasks, managing time, and making efficient decisions in daily life. This project addresses:
* Helping users prioritize tasks and schedule effectively
* Providing recommendations for daily decisions using AI
* Supporting learning by suggesting personalized educational content

## How is it used?
Users interact with the AI assistant via a simple web or mobile interface. They can input tasks, questions, or learning goals, and the AI provides:
* Task prioritization and reminders
* Decision-making support
* Personalized learning recommendations
Target users include students, professionals, and anyone looking to improve daily productivity.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data sources:
* Publicly available task management datasets
* Open educational resources
* User-generated input data
AI techniques:
* Machine learning classification for task prioritization
* Recommendation systems for learning content
* Natural language processing (NLP) for understanding user queries

## Challenges
This project does not:
* Guarantee perfect decision-making
* Replace human judgment
* Access private data without user permission
Ethical considerations include user privacy, data security, and avoiding biased recommendations.

## What next?
Future improvements could include:
* Real-time integration with calendar apps
* Voice interface for easier interaction
* Collaboration with productivity experts and educators
* Browser or mobile extensions for seamless usage

## Acknowledgments
* Inspired by Elements of AI course materials
* Open-source AI libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and spaCy
